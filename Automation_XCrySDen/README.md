XCrySDen is a visualization software suitable with Quantum Espresso, CRYSTAL, and many more. It is developed by Professor Anton Kokalj (tone.kokalj@ijs.si).

The Purpose of the script is to iterate on Quantum Espresso output files, and rotate the structure in x,y, and z (depending on your preferences). Then, it will show hydrogen bonds and capture an image. As a result, making videos for your simulation will be easy and will save much time.

To make the script work:
1) copy the script into this path on your laptop: /usr/share/xcrysden/examples/Scripting
2) to edit please use: sudo nano File_Name.
3) on your terminal call xcrysden by ./xcrysden.
4) From the Menu, choose File > XCrySDen Examples > File_Name
