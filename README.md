This script is developed based on Quantum Espresso. The purpose is to automize the stress-strain curve calculations (Brute-Force Approach), and it could be used for either True Strain or Engineered Strain calculations. The provided script is designed for True Strain calculations in uniaxial directions.  
As a result, six scripts are provided in total: three for Tension and three for Compression (A-axis, B-axis, and C-axis).
